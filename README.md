# osrsupdater
Tool that uses Java Bytecode Analysis on an OSRS Jar File

Basically a base for an OSRS Updater, I didn't get far in it because I stopped playing Runescape.

IIRC, It correctly identifies the following classes
- Client
- Node


*Uses the ASM Library(Tree) to conduct Java Bytecode Analysis
